We are delighted to be able to welcome you to Stuttgart and show you our wonderful city.

Stuttgart - one of the most beautiful cities in Europe - can by no means be envied solely on account of its location and many parks, gardens and forests and woods. Stuttgart - it's more than just the state capital of Baden-Württemberg, more than an active congress and economic metropolis. Stuttgart is a city with interesting attractions, a world-renowned ballet, excellent cultural and sporting highlights, diverse leisure and accommodation possibilities and an international variety theatre.

Charmingly situated in one of the largest wine-growing regions in Germany, Stuttgart impresses, on the one hand with its wonderful panoramic view, beautiful squares, splendid castles and palaces and buildings with diverse architectural styles, and, on the other with its diverse cultural offering.

Whoever thinks of Stuttgart thinks of world-renowned car factories, high-tech and computer manufacturing, VfB Stuttgart, the Cannstatter Volksfest (funfair & folk festival), the Stuttgart Ballet, and perhaps also the Swabian cuisine, spätzle and wine.

The capital city of the south-western federal state of Baden-Württemberg, which was founded in 1952, has 578,523 inhabitants and is the core of one of the strongest industrial regions in the federal state of Germany, the Central Neckar region. It provides approximately 470,600 jobs alone, the entire region 1,462,300.

Baden-Württemberg's state capital is gaining increasing importance in Europe. With its globally oriented research and economical structure, the international character of its population, as well as a variety of consular representatives, Stuttgart has the best conditions to play a decisive role in the top group of European metropolitan regions.
