Madrid is the capital of Spain, and is home to the Spanish Royal family as well as the Spanish Government. It is a modern metropolitan city and an economical and industrial center of Spain, and, with its population of nearly 3,5 million people, is also the biggest city in Spain.
It is located in the centre of the Iberian Peninsula, and is surrounded by mountains and natural parks. Although it is located in the centre of the country, it has traditionally been the hub between different areas of Spain and is therefore connected to all major Spanish cities by train, road or air.

The weather in Madrid varies a lot depending on the season, from hot and dry in the summer, with temperature of approx. 29C-¦ / 85F-¦, to cold (4C-¦ / 39F-¦) and with some rain in the winter.
